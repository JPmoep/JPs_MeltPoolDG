# (DG)-FEM-based multi-phase flow solvers for high-fidelity metal additive manufacturing process simulations

This package provides solvers for simulating the complex multi-physics processes in the vicinity of the melt pool during SLM. It is based on continuous and discontinuous finite element methods in an Eulerian setting. For interface tracking between the different phases and (in the future) phase transition, level set methods and (in the future) phase-field methods will be provided.

This project depends on the following third-party libraries:

    * dealii
    * p4est
    * trilinos
