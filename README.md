# MeltPoolDG
## (DG)-FEM-based multi-phase flow solvers for high-fidelity metal additive manufacturing process simulations

The aim of this project is to provide solvers for simulating the thermo-hydrodynamics in the vicinity of the melt pool during selective laser melting, including melt pool formation and the interaction of the multi-phase flow system (liquid metal/ambient gas/metal vapor). They are based on continuous and discontinuous finite element methods in an Eulerian setting. For modelling interfaces in the multi-phase flow problem including evaporation, level set methods and phase-field methods will be provided.

This project depends on the following third-party libraries:

    * dealii
    * p4est
    * Trilinos
